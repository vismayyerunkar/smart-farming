            content:'It’s hard to beat the taste of fresh homegrown tomatoes. These favorite vegetables require several months of warm summer weather to produce a bountiful harvest. Tomatoes are heavy feeders, needing rich soil and fertilizer to thrive. Choose a site that receives full sun and provide regular water and supplemental fertilizer for the highest yields. Wait to transplant outdoors until nighttime temperatures are at least 55 degrees F. Plants will need trellising, caging, or staking to support fruits.',

            content:'This versatile warm weather vegetable comes in hundreds of different varieties, from mild to screeching hot, to suit every taste. Because of the long growing time, plants will need to be started indoors or purchased as nursery starts. Wait to plant outdoors until nighttime temperatures are consistently 60 degrees F or above. Peppers thrive in a sunny site with rich well-draining soil. Add an all-purpose fertilizer formulated for vegetables to the soil at the time of planting and keep plants evenly moist. Plants will need staking or caging to keep from bending over or breaking from the weight of the fruit.',

            content:'Though they are not vegetables, berries are a must-have addition to any edible landscape. Choose varieties that produce fruit at different times during the summer for a longer harvest. For those with limited space, select dwarf varieties that can be grown in containers. Blueberries need at least two plants for cross pollination, while other types are self-pollinating. Make sure to research cultural needs for each type. Plant in full sun, keep plants well watered during summer and cover with bird netting when berries start to ripen',

            content:'Biting into a sweet, juicy melon slice is one of summertime’s greatest pleasures. Melons need lots of heat, water, rich soil, and fertilizer to develop ripe, succulent fruit. Choose a south-facing site that receives reflected heat and allow plenty of room for vines to sprawl. Wait to sow seeds until soil temperature is 65-70 degrees F, or plant from nursery starts. Use heat-enhancing methods such as a cloche or black plastic to warm the soil and speed plant growth.',

For best results, wait to direct sow seeds until the soil warms up to 60-70 degrees F. Train these vining plants on a fence or trellis, or allow them plenty of room to sprawl. Make sure plants receive plenty of regular water to keep fruit from becoming bitter or misshapen. Harvest frequently to encourage new fruit.',

Beets are an annual cool-season crop, half-hardy to frost and light freezes. They thrive in all parts of the country. Beets are closely related to spinach and chard, and once called "blood turnips" because of their bright red juice.   Growing beets will provide delicious colorful roots and nutritious greens. ',

            content:"Broccoli is an annual cool-season crop hardy to frosts and light freezing, often overlooked and overcooked. Broccoli is sensitive to the heat, if the weather is too hot, it will flower quickly and won't produce an edible head, it tends to grow best in the fall due to the more predictable cool weather. To prevent spreading clubroot and other soil-borne diseases, don't compost brassica roots. Some gardeners won't compost any part of the plant. Also, rotate the placement of brassica plants in your garden so they aren't in the same 10-foot radius for at least 3 consecutive years. Some experts recommend a rotation of 7 years. Headed broccoli is the most common form in the United States, with big central heads closely packed with buds",

Plant in rows 3 feet apart, with 30 inches between the plants. Brussels Sprouts should not be grown within a 10 foot radius of any brassica growing location within the last 3 years, preferably 7 years. Brussels Sprouts are high in calcium and iron, as well as a good source of vitamins A and C',

Try growing them this spring in an area that previously grew potatoes or something that has caused the soil to be worked up a little bit. ?The looser the soil, the bigger variety you can grow.  Carrots are an annual cool-season crop, half-hardy to frost and light freezes. They develop quite normally under a variety of temperature conditions, except very warm temperatures. It is often said that frost, or cold weather will make them even sweeter. Sow seeds evenly in a very shallow furrow, about 1/4 inch deep, and keep seeds moist so they will germinate.Space rows about 12" apart and when the first leaves emerge, thin to 1" apart; when true leaves emerge, thin to 3" apart.',

            content:`Celery seed is usually started indoors about 10 weeks before it is time to set the plants outdoors - that is, after the soil is warm and the air temperature settled. The seed is minute and finicky, and is started in much the same manner as African violet seed, in closed containers to keep seedlings moist. Soak seeds overnight to help germination. Transplant seedlings (see: Guide to Transplanting Your Seedlings) outside when they are 4-6 inches tall and night temperatures don't fall below 40F. Water plants before they are transplanted. Plant in rows 2 feet apart; with 6 - 8 inches between plants.`,
